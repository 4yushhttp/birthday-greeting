      <h1>Heartfelt Wishes 💌</h1>
      <p>May your life be filled with joy, laughter, and endless love 💫</p>
      <p>
     From the endless laughter we’ve shared to the quiet moments that said everything without a word — 
     every memory with you feels like a page from my favorite story. 
     I still remember the silly jokes, the unexpected adventures probably the rainy one , 
     and how talking with you could turn an ordinary day into something magical. 
     You’ve been my constant light through every season i mean it's very less i only met you for a month but it was so beautiful and all the people surrounded were so beautifull,
      and every second spent with you has become a piece of my heart I’ll cherish forever. On your special day, 
      I just want you to know how deeply you’re loved — not just today, but in every moment that’s yet to come. 💫❤️

  <p>You’re amazing! Have a magical year ahead 🥳</p>
  <p>Hope one day you see me like how I saw you every minute, and if I look like a fool for doing it again and again, I must do it once more.</p>
  <p>Ohh, to be surrounded by your presence, your laugh, and my jokes. Ohh, to be with you and see you smile over and over again.</p>
  <p>I don't know how you feel about me, but I never saw someone like I saw you, and probably it's not just about the aesthetics but the light you carry, the talks you do, and the thoughts you have. Yes, I admire you whenever I look at you.</p>
  <p>It's too early to ask for, but I will wait till I make myself a strong man who stands for self and for others too.</p>
  <p>I may sound like a freak or whatever you think, but I would love to be with you and be completed by you.</p>
  <p>Just in case you ever felt lost and sad, just remember you are loved in many ways through my eyes.</p>
  <p>I want you to go for the conversation that you were not ready to tell yourself.</p>
  <p>And yes, I'll be there every moment.</p>
  <p>I promise you this: I always look out for you.</p>
